Have data that you want to analyze in the research platform? 
Use the IntelliMatch service to move your text, Excel or csv file into a table in your personal schema.
Just select the file and load. It's that easy. But wait, that's not all! Use IntelliMatch to automate 
record matching projects or link against the NYCO workforce data sets. No file is too large and no data 
is too data!
